## **Project Overview**

The **Incident Response System** is a cybersecurity project designed to streamline incident reporting processes. This project showcases two distinct prototypes:
- **Prototype A:** A traditional, multi-step form-based approach for incident reporting.
- **Prototype B:** An interactive chatbot widget that offers a conversational and user-friendly incident reporting experience.

The goal is to improve user experience and efficiency through the interactive chatbot system while providing a comparison of the two approaches.

## **Features**

- **Prototype A:**
  - Multi-step form for detailed incident reporting.
  - Progress bar for tracking completion.
  - Traditional form-based structure.

- **Prototype B:**
  - Conversational chatbot interface for streamlined incident reporting.
  - Dynamic response handling based on user inputs.
  - Interactive and user-friendly design.

- **Other Features:**
  - Real-time validation for inputs.
  - Success page with navigation options.
  - Fully responsive design for both prototypes.
