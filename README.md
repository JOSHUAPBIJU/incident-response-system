## **Project Overview**

Cybersecurity incidents pose a growing challenge for organizations, requiring effective reporting mechanisms to ensure timely responses. This project evaluates two different **User Interface (UI) approaches** for incident reporting:

- **Prototype A:** A traditional **multi-step form-based** UI.
- **Prototype B:** An **interactive chatbot-based** UI that provides a conversational experience.

The research aims to analyze how **interface design impacts user efficiency, error rates, and preference** in cybersecurity reporting. A comparative study is conducted, testing user performance and collecting usability feedback through a **System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire**.
