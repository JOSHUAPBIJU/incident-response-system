## **Project Overview**

The **Incident Response System** is part of the **Interactive Systems** subject, focusing on creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. This project includes two prototypes aimed at improving user interaction, making it more engaging and accessible:
- **Prototype A:** A multi-step form-based approach for user input.
- **Prototype B:** An interactive chatbot widget that offers a conversational interface for the same tasks.

The goal is to compare these prototypes and demonstrate how interactivity can enhance the user experience.

**This project is a work in progress, with additional features and refinements planned.**
