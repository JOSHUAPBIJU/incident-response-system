## **Project Overview**

Cybersecurity incidents pose a growing challenge for organizations, requiring effective reporting mechanisms to ensure timely responses. This project evaluates two different **User Interface (UI) approaches** for incident reporting:

- **Prototype A:** A traditional **multi-step form-based** UI.
- **Prototype B:** An **interactive chatbot-based** UI that provides a conversational experience.

The research aims to analyze how **interface design impacts user efficiency, error rates, and preference** in cybersecurity reporting. A comparative study is conducted, testing user performance and collecting usability feedback through a **System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire**.

## **Features**

- **Prototype A (Form-Based UI):**
  - Multi-step structured form with manual data entry.
  - Progress indicator to track completion.
  - Traditional step-by-step interaction.

- **Prototype B (Chatbot-Based UI):**
  - Conversational chatbot for guided incident reporting.
  - Users can select predefined responses or enter short replies.
  - Single scrolling interface for smooth workflow.

- **Research & Data Analysis:**
  - Performance metrics: **Task completion time & error rate** comparison.
  - User experience evaluation using **SUS questionnaire**.
  - Statistical analysis via a **paired t-test**.
